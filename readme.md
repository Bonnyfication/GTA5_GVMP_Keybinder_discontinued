# Project Title

Discontinued keybinder for GTA 5 / GVMP Roleplay Server. The keybinder did add you to the GVMP Whitelist and let you set some hotkeys with commands. 
With these bindings the code created a AHK Script that handles the Hotkey function and hooks the game.

This project only served as proof of concept and is very error-prone. For inspiration and everything else you are welcome to use it.
